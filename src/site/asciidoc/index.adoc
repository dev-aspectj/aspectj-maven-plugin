## AspectJ Maven Plugin

This plugin weaves AspectJ aspects into your classes using the AspectJ compiler `ajc`. Typically, aspects are used in
one of two ways within your Maven reactors:

  * As part of a _single project_, implying aspects and code are defined within the same Maven project. This is the
    simplest approach to start out with. Feel free to examine the xref:usage.adoc#_basic_usage[basic usage] example to
    better understand single-project use.

  * As part of a _multi-module Maven reactor_ where one or more modules contain aspects and other modules within the
    Maven reactor contain code affected ("woven") by those aspects. This is a more complex and powerful approach, best
    suited when several Maven projects should be woven by a common set of aspects. The
    xref:multimodule/multimodule_strategy.adoc[AspectJ in a multi-module reactor] example contains a basic walk-through
    of this approach.

AspectJ Maven Plugin delegates most of its work to the AspectJ compiler `ajc` or documentation creator `ajdoc` included
within the plugin. Refer to link:https://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/ for information and documentation about AspectJ
itself.

### Plugin, AspectJ and Java version compatibility

Each new version of AspectJ Maven Plugin by default uses the most recent AspectJ Compiler (AJC) version available at
the release date. The plugin itself only requires Java 8, but depending on the AJC version you use, a more recent Java
version might be necessary to run the build. For example, AspectJ 1.9.8+ requires a Java 11 runtime, AspectJ
1.9.21+ requires Java 17.

Good news: All more recent AspectJ versions can still compile to lower source/target levels, i.e. your _compiled
programs_ still run on older Java versions, if you wish.

If for some reason you also need to run your _build_ on an older Java version, you can downgrade the `aspectjtools`
plugin dependency to an older version. Or the other way around, you can also upgrade to a newer `aspectjtools` version
without upgrading the plugin. You have maximum flexibility, depending on your usage scenario. You only ever need to
upgrade the plugin, if you need a new feature or bugfix of the plugin itself.

For more information see xref:usage.adoc#_upgrading_or_downgrading_aspectj[Upgrading or downgrading AspectJ] and
