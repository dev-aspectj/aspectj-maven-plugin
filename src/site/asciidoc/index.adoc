AspectJ Maven Plugin

  This plugin weaves AspectJ aspects into your classes using the AspectJ compiler ("ajc").
  Typically, aspects are used in one of two ways within your Maven reactors:

  * As part of a <Single Project>, implying aspects and code are defined within the same Maven project.
    This is the simplest approach to start out with; feel free to examine the
    "Examples: Single-project AspectJ use" to better understand single-project use.

  * As part of a <Multi-module Maven Reactor> where one/some project(s) contains aspects and other
    projects within the Maven reactor contain code using the aspects ("woven by the aspects").
    This is a more complex and powerful approach, best suited when several Maven projects should be woven
    by a common set of aspects. The "Examples: Multi-module AspectJ use" contains a basic walkthrough
    of this approach.

  The AspectJ Maven Plugin delegates most of its work to the AspectJ dependencies included within
  the plugin. (Refer to {{https://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/}} for descriptions and documentation about
  AspectJ itself).

  <<Please note:>> Before version 1.13.1, this plugin by default depended on an AspectJ Compiler (AJC) version which was
  able to run on Java 8. Since 1.13.1 however, it depends on AspectJ 1.9.8.RC1 or higher, where AJC requires Java 11+.
  This requirement is inherited from the Eclipse Java Compiler (ECJ) which AJC is a fork of.
  If you wish to use an older AspectJ version (e.g. 1.9.8.M1, 1.9.7 or lower), please follow the description in section
  "Upgrading or downgrading AspectJ" on the "Usage" page. Then you can run the build on JDK 8 again.
